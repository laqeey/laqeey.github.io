I contributed to the development of a new dataset in collaboration with the Lab for Measurement Technology, Saarland University.  
The dataset, titled *A Machine Learning Dataset of Artificial Inner Ring Damages on Cylindrical Roller Bearings Measured Under Varying Cross-Influences*, is now available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11108503).
