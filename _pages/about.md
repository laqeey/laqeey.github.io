Hi everyone! I'm Yage Zhang — or you can just call me **Laqeey** /ˈlɑː.tʃi/.

I am currently a Master's student in Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Saarland University, Germany, and a student research assistant(HIWI) at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/de/people/c02yazh).

My research interests lie in the security of generative AI models and the content safety on social media platforms.
