Hi everyone! I'm Yage Zhang — or you can just call me **Laqeey** /ˈlɑː.tʃi/.

I am currently a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), jointly supervised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/de/research/groups/backes). Prior to this, I completed my Master's in the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at Saarland University, where I also worked as a student research assistant (HiWi) at CISPA.

My research interests focus on the following:
1. **Security of Generative AI Models**  
2. **Structured Robustness of Models**  
3. **Proactive Harmful Content Detection with Trustworthy Machine Learning**
