Hi everyone! I'm Yage Zhang — or you can just call me **Laqeey** /ˈlɑː.tʃi/.

I am currently a PhD student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), jointly supervised by [Prof. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/de/research/groups/backes). Prior to this, I obtained my Master degree at Saarland University.

My research interests focus on the **Security and Structured Robustness of Generative AI Models** and the **Proactive Harmful Content Detection with Trustworthy Machine Learning**.
